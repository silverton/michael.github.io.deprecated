    And now, for a BONUS #OSINT kids P.S. & Nano-Novel in 3 lines of dialog. You're welcome! Love you MORE, because, yeah LOVE is a contest to be won, right, All Great and Powerful Mother of Hystrionic Narcissistic Personality Mastery?
    
    ## This Nano-Novel Dedicated to Ethel's perfect re-enactments and countless portrayals of the Judas Kiss. THOUSANDS of impeccable performances! Where's her OSINT OSCAR!?

        A (probably fictional) parallel timeline story:

            "How DARE you!?" she screeched. Enraged, sledge-hammering the same words into the email. "How DARE you? Do you know WHO I AM?"

            [Minutes later]: "Guess I know, now," he politely replied. "And, the fact of the matter is that you are not helping."
            
            [Seconds later]: Her one tap on speed-dial ordered his immediate and complete social annhilation, up to and including material elimination, if necessary.
            
            -- The End

    ### Siskel & Ebert Review: Isn't it funny how the one screaming, "You can't handle the truth!" is the one who can't handle the truth? Hey, it *just* a movie, right?

    P.S.S. Remember there are ALWAYS NEVER any absolutes, THAT is an absolute ABSOLUTE. I want my journals back, Lauren. You're the super subgenius, you know how to get it done, so please do. I have much more WORK to do; oh, but that's exactly WHY you stole my WORK, isn't it, in attempt to once again force me to do YOUR work. Yeah, no.
           Never was, never will acceed to YOUR corrupt money game. All money is ALWAYS NEVER about the money (even if individual dupes and pawns fall for it). 
           Weaponized money is an EMP, ALWAYS EVER only about the Ethic, Morality, and Principles motivating the game, and however sane, ethical, moral, and principled the game design, apparently, and infinitely sadly, human corruption seems eternally deep enough to rise to the occassion of desecration of the sacred.
           It is THIS that I have 100% FAILED to ever comprehend. How could any being stand face to face with a buddha, a sadhu, the Christ, and say, "Nah, no thanks. I got this. I know BETTER. I know BEST. I am not only 'as god,' I am greater than the One True Creator."
           Who could say such and do such a thing, at the end of all time, space, and phenomena? Oh yeah. You. Congratulations. You have your reward.
