    <meta name="description" content="Nobody likes a snarky truth-teller. Seems like that's only a bad deal for those who live to be liked by those who (probably, often) despise them, and (usually, at best) are so uttlerly self-absorbed as to be incapable of caring one way or another about anyone but themselves. Isn't it? Remember when 'don't be evil' meant people were not supposed to be able to buy their way to the top of search and then a whole industry to do just that was born? Ah, the good old days. A rabbi once said, 'If the world hated me, it's gonna' hate you. Do your best to do your best to live agape, anyway.' You'll fail, a LOT, keep trying again, anyway. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk. Love you more. Peace.">
