    BONUS.P.S.SHORT: A (probably fictional) parallel timeline story: "How DARE you!?" she screeched. Enraged, sledge-hammering the same words into the email. "How DARE ... you? Do you know WHO I AM?"<br />

    <!-- P.S.S. I want my journals back, Lauren. You're the super subgenius, you know how to get it done. Please get it done. Today. I have much more WORK to do; oh, but that's exactly why you stole my WORK, isn't it? -->
